            I come from  Antalya, Turkey where I graduated from the Akdeniz University.
            <br />

            <br />I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since I've always been passionate about computers, I was drawn into becoming an intern and later a Software Developer.
            <br />
            <br /> I worked in a start-up for 2 years and then I decided to become a Full Stack Developer.
            <br /><br />I have been working as a Freelancer over a year.
            <br /><br />
            In a constant search for new opportunities, challenges and ways to enchance my performace and upgrade my skills.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do include Traveling, which has become my lifestyle.
            <br /> <br />  I am a digital nomad, who has become a passionate explorer of the world, and visited 6 countries in the last year, all while working remotely with a motivation and focus.
            <br /> <br /> On a daily basis, I enjoy:
